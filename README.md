## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Rashwanth Jeyaprakash


I'm a recent **Finance graduate** with a growing passion for **data analytics** and how it drives smarter business decisions. With a foundation in numbers and business strategy, Iâ€™m now focused on building real-world analytics skills across tools like **Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau** by building real-word projects as part of my learning journey and certifications path.

**Whether itâ€™s wrangling messy datasets or creating interactive visuals, I enjoy making data useful â€” not just beautiful.**
